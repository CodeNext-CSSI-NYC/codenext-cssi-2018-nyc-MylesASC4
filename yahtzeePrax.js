let randomNum = require('random-int')

// 1. Write a function that rolls a single six-sided die and returns the result.
function rollDie() {

return randomNum(1,6)
}
// console.log(rollDie())


// 2. Write a function that rolls five separate dice and returns the result in an array.
// This function should in turn call the function from #1 above.
function rollFiveDice() {
   let rolls5 = []
    for( i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    rolls5.push( rollDie() )
    }

return rolls5 
}
// An example return value is [2,3,5,1,2];


// rollFiveDice()
// 3. Write a function that takes in an array of five dice rolls and returns an
// object in which the keys are the rolls and the values are the frequency of the rolls.
// So if the array passed in is [2,3,5,1,2], then the return from this function is:
// {2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1, 1: 1} because two appears twice and 1/3/5 appear once.
function createCounts(arr) {
    let numOfNums = {}
    
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        let num = arr[i]

    if(numOfNums[num] == undefined){
    numOfNums[num] = 1
    }
    else{
        numOfNums[num]++
    }
}
console.log(numOfNums)
}

// createCounts(rollFiveDice())
console.log(createCounts(rollFiveDice()))


// You should test out this function by first calling the function in #2,
// storing the result in a variable, then calling this function and passing in that
// variable as the input to this function.



// Note: I will refer to the object returned by #3 above as a "counter object"
// from here on out. I will be referring to it a lot. A "counter object" has keys
// that are the numbers of the dice, and values that represent how many of the five
// dice rolled that number. So the values should always add up to 5.



// 3b. Write a function isValid that takes in a counter object and checks that the values add up to 5.
// It should return true or false. For example, if you pass in {2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1, 1: 1}
// it should return true, but {2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1, 1: 2} should return false.
// Feel free to use this function anywhere else in the code if you'd like.



// 4. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a two-of-a-kind. This means that at least one of the counts is 2 or higher.
function hasTwoOfAKind(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasTwoOfAKind({1:3, 2:1, 6:1}) and make sure it says true.



// 5. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a three-of-a-kind. This means that one of the counts is 3 or higher.
function hasThreeOfAKind(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasThreeOfAKind({1:3, 2:1, 6:1}) and make sure it says true.



// 6. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a four-of-a-kind. This means that one of the counts is 4 or higher.
function hasFourOfAKind(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasFourOfAKind({1:3, 2:1, 6:1}) and make sure it says false and make another
// one that does have it.



// 7. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a yahtzee (all five are the same). This means that one of the counts is 5.
function hasYahtzee(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasYahtzee({1:5}) and make sure it says true.



// 8. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a full house. This means that one of the counts is 3 and a different one is 2.
function hasFullHouse(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasFullHouse({1:3, 5:2}) and make sure it says true.



// 9. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a small straight. This means that either all of the values from 1-4 appear at least once,
// or all the values from 2-5 appear at least once, or all the values from 3-6 appear at least once.
function hasSmallStraight(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasFullHouse({3:1, 4:1, 5:2, 6:1}) and make sure it says true.



// 10. Write a function that determines whether or not a counter object contains
// a large straight. This means that either all of the values from 1-5 appear at least once,
// or all the values from 2-6 appear at least once.
function hasLargeStraight(obj) {

}
// You can test this out by calling #2 and #3 above to create counter objects,
// or you can just create your own and pass them in. For example, you could call
// hasFullHouse({2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1}) and make sure it says true.
