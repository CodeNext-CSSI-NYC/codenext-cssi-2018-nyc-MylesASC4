// 1a. Use a while loop to print out numbers from 1 to 10
// 1b. Use a while loop to print out numbers from 30 to 15
let num = 30

// while(num > 14){
//     console.log(num)
//     num --
// }


// 2. Write a program that keeps rolling a die until the roll is a 5. Print out each roll.
// If you haven't yet done so, you should run
// npm install random-int
// and use that to get a random number from 1 to 6.
// Google "npm random-int" for more info.
let int = random(1,6)
// while (int != 5) {
//     console.log(int);
//     int = random(1,6)



// 3. Write a program that asks the user to guess a secret password.
// Until the user enters the correct password (which is chosen by you in advance),
// the program will keep asking for all eternity. When they finally do enter the
// correct password, exit the loop and print a congratulatory message.

let guess = user.question( "Please enter your password: ")

let answer = guess
while(answer != "password"){    
   answer = user.question( "Please enter your password: ")
    
}
console.log("Welcome in.")
// Hint: Declare userInput outside the loop and initialize it to the value of readline.question("Enter password: ").
// The while loop will check if userInput matches the correct password.
// If not, inside the loop you should print "Sorry! That's incorrect", then
// assign userInput to the value of readline.question("Enter password: ") again.

// Bonus: Enhance your program to only allow the user to try entering the correct password three times.
// If they fail three times, the program should kick them out and tell them they are a robot.
// When the user enters the wrong password, the program tells them that they are wrong,
// along with how many attempts they've made so far.
